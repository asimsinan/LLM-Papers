     ### Abstract
     BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).
     ### Bullet Points

   * BERT improves GLUE score, MultiNLI accuracy, SQuAD v1.1 question answering test F1 to 93.2, and SQAD V2.0 test F1, resulting in new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks.
